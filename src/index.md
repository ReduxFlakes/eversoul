## Welcome to SurfScape

SurfScape is a project focused on developing resources, services, and software to help people build their own personal space on the web, escape big corporations, and learn more about privacy and accessibility values.

## Things to do

As of now most of SurfScape is still in construction, however there is content available, but you should consider them in a alpha state.

- [Directory](/library/directory) - Various web services categorized and ranked by their privacy measures;
- [Resources](/library/resources) - Sites and resources on various topics (web building, minimalism, etc);
- [Community](/community) - Our Discord server (more platforms in the future).
