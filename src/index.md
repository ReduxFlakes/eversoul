## Welcome to SurfScape

SurfScape is a project focused on developing resources, services, and software to help people build their own personal space on the web, escape big corporations, and learn more about privacy and accessibility values.

## Things to do

As of now most of SurfScape is still in construction, however we are already offering content and services to everyone, although you should consider them in a still alpha state.
