Departments is a way to contact us about a certain topic, this could be about general issues with the web portal to something like privacy issues and so on. This makes it easy for everyone using our service get their response to something they want to know.

Every department contains a F.A.Q with questions that most people might be searching for, either way you have the option to contact us.
