We've recently rewrote SurfScape from scratch to improve some big flaws from the old design, even though we feel this is the best of SurfScape yet, we want to know your own opinion about it. This applies to both people that used the old version or that are new to the project. The new portal is still in alpha so expect some issues here and there. We don't ask any personal information.
