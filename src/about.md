## Your favorite Neocities web portal!

SurfScape is an [open source]() web portal for Neocitiies. It was created to offer services, resources, but most importantly, fight big corporations to take back their control on our web. We also help other create their space on the web and offer guides on how to. SurfScape will also help programmers host their projects on our portal.

We hope in the future we can create a friendly and active community for everyone from coding, to artists, and writers.

Our vision for SurfScape is to showcase the best of what the web had and still has to offer. Whether youâ€™re a fan of personal pages, zines, or services that empower the web, SurfScape is the place for you!

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                    Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
