This document explains why the SurfScape Project exists. Our main goal is to demonstrate the power of a free, community-driven internet without corporate influence.

To achieve this, we provide free services and an open-source platform for anyone who wants to reclaim the web and create their own space, free from greed and nonsense. We believe that everyone can have a voice online, regardless of their limitations or creativity.

We also emphasize the importance of privacy as a fundamental human right and oppose corporations that control our data.

SurfScape is a community-driven project, available to anyone who wants to help reclaim the internet. If you share our vision and want to make a difference, [join us](/community)!

- ReduxFlakes, Founder of the SurfScape Project.
