## What is it?

Labs is an open source project tracker that is used to track new ideas for services and products in development publicly.

It's main objective is to see what features should and could be implemeneted, the roadblocks, and if it's viable to develop the project into a public product.

SurfScape Labs is also used to track the progress of a project in development, and let's user preview a project in development if the same is being tested publicly.
