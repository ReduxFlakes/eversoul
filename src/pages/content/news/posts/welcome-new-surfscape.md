After months of work and some procrastination, here is a preview of SurfScape version 1.0, codenamed Liberty!

Although this release is not yet feature-complete, it's a step up from the older releases, and it's considered stable, despite having some sharp edges.

Let's dive into some of the major changes done and what's coming next on future releases!

## Design

The most noticeable change is the design. I know people will hate the new design because it's flat, modern, and doesn't have the same creativity, and you're right, the old, frutiger aero-inspired was a lot cooler and friendlier, but what is not cool is having hundred lines of CSS to maintain when half of them are for gradients and shadows.
For comparasion, the old homepage had 2x more CSS than HTML, meaning design had more priority than actual content. This time however, SurfScape Liberty has way less CSS in general, and it's also a lot easier to make it mobile responsive thus making SurfScape more accessible, which is one our ethics and values.

Under the hood, SurfScape is powered by our very own UI framework, SurfKit. It's like a secret weapon that helps us build the UI using components, making everything cohesive and tied together. The main goal of SurfKit lies in its modularity, making it easy to update and customize. This means that in a not-so-distant future, SurfKit will have support for themes, allowing you to craft your own unique SurfScape. The best part? You'll be able to share your themes to us, making your theme available to anyone that uses SurfScape.

Although exciting, our focus right now is on creating content first. We want SurfScape to be more than just a pretty website; we want it to be a frontpage for content and a source for promoting the personal web/indie web, and offer resources to newcomers on the community.

## Content

The big issue with SurfScape. Yes, SurfScape does not have almost any content, yet. This is release candidate 1, which means it's the first iteration of version 1.0 and thus not considered "stable".

This release is more to fix the old quirks of older releases and lay a better foundation for content. To keep people updated, we have created a [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/surfscape/projects/10) where you can track our progress for the next release candidate, and you'll see that RC2 is 90% focused on content!

### Directory

RC1 also has improved directory submissions to make it easier for you to submit sites to the directory!

So, consider this release candidate a promise of what's to come. We're committed to filling SurfScape with content (personal or not).

## What's coming next?

Now, let's talk about what's coming next for SurfScape. First up, we are planning to bring back the Web Services Directory. It's main goal is to showcase privacy-respecting web services, including search engines, social media platforms, and email providers. This time however, we will be implementing a clear set of submission guidelines and categories to make it easier for people to submit new services.

Next up is our resources pages, named "Links" and "Bookmarks." Think of Links as a weekly or monthly listing of personal websites, while Bookmarks is an ever-growing directory of all-time favorite sites.

### Services

Now let's talk about [SurfScape Services](/services/). Some might remember our first service, [GameVortex](https://surfscape.github.io/gamevortex), a portal for flash games. While it was somewhat popular, the project was hard to maintain due to the varying nature of flash games. So, we've planned to restart development with a new framework, [Astro](https://astro.build), to create a more manageable experience. We've even got a new logo for it, which you can check out on the [Services page](/services).

Another service on the planning board is [NeoFrame](https://neoframe.neocities.org). Imagine it as a one-stop shop for all things related to web building and design. It will offer templates, layouts, buttons, images, fonts, icons, and more. The challenge with NeoFrame is maintaining and organizing such a huge amount of content.

### Closing Marks

So, there you have it â€“ the new SurfScape codenamed Liberty. This initial release candidate is just the beginning. Stay tuned for upcoming news! Bye, bye! ðŸ¤—
