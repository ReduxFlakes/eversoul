description: Announcing our new branding and decision behind the change
---

As we are approaching the stable release, we thought that our current branding wasn't that original, I mean it was just a ball with some reflexions and a nice gradient but nothing more, and that's why we announce our new branding!

</figure>

As you can see, it's much more relaxed but also much nicer than the bubble. It also comes in 3 variants and it finally has a meaning behind it.

## The meaning

So at face value, SurfScape started as a web portal for news and personal websites on the Neocities community, and so that's what the logo is, a spiral forming a portal and in the middle a star signifying _everything_, which if you didn't know, was the same meaning as our older branding.

## Banner and slogan

This new refresh also brings a new slogan and a new social banner that is already up on our [Fosstodon profile](https://fosstodon.org/@surfscape) (follow us!).

</figure>

As you can see that description suits us much better than our old one.

However, this does not mean our old slogan will be replaced, instead, we will now have two ways to express the objective of SurfScape, those being the new slogan but also the old one, which are the following:

> **Your Web, Your Way** - related to the way we promote the open/indie web, where you are in control.

> **Your favorite Neocities web portal** - from way back, where SurfScape was still called NetFind/Eversoul, and also why wouldn't we be your favorite web portal? Aren't we your favorite? ðŸ˜”

## Usage of our branding and slogan

As active supporters of the open web, free speech, and online freedom, we allow you to use our branding as long as you don't do the following:

- Promoting something not related to us in the name of SurfScape;
- Using a different color palette, scalling, or typography;
- Using our branding for commercial purposes (unless with permission);
- Using our brand idendity as if it was yours;

A branding kit is currently being made as a way to help people use our branding correctly, but until then, don't be afraid to contact us about it's usage or permission to do so, we allow it as long as you specify your reason behind it's usage.

## Closing

Even though there wasn't a lot of new changes and updates these last weeks, I feel like most things are coming together and we are getting closer and closer of reaching a stable release. So that's it for today, or at least I hope so, I want to try and make more updates as soon as possible, until then, fly high on the indie web ocean!
