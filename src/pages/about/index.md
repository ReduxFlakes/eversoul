## &ldquo;Creating resources about the open web and developing beautiful, minimal, services and software with privacy and security in mind.&#8221;

SurfScape is a project created to offer services, content, and resources related to the open web, privacy, freedom of speech, and other related themes, all still being free as in beer and as in speech.

Currently the home of the SurfScape project is on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/site/surfscape), however we have plans to expand to other hosts so that SurfScape becomes more resilient and more accessible.
