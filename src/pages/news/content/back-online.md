We are happy to announce that SurfScape is back online, now on version 2.0.0.

This post will go trough some of the new changes, what is currently planned and what is the future of SurfScape.

## New look & features

We've decided to focus on the core of SurfScape, that being a portal for various types of content related to the personal web and privacy, so we decided to scale back complex layouts, layers of CSS, and focus on just content.

One of the main changes is the new look and redesigned layout. We decided to scrap the 2000's frutiger aero design to a more minimal and linear design still powered by SurfKit but now easier to find information and read content.

Some of the new features include a wider viewport with responsive font sizes meaning that the portal should respond and look much better on both desktop, mobile, or even in an overpriced VR headset <small> _cough cough_ Vision Pro _cough cough_</small>. There's also a table of contents present in most pages to help with navigation on heavy content as well as heading anchors that show when hovering/clicking headings so that you can get the url to that specific section.

Other small features that you might notice on some pages is a secondary footer that is shown when a page has been updated, which includes the date of the last update as well as a link to it's older revision if available. Also talking about footers is the addition of a link to edit the page in GitHub on the main footer.

And finally is the addition of a reading time counter on posts (only available on news at the moment) that shows the average time in minutes that takes to read the main content of the post.

## Planned changes

Some of the planned features for upcoming releases is the addition of a site-wide search bar, forms for adding new content to the portal, improve the design system with a more modernised look, and the public release of SurfKit for personal use.

## The near future

This is speculation and not fixed ideas so please take this section with a grain of salt.

The most waited project of SurfScape are the services, specifically GameVortex which was supposed to enter stable phase last year, unfortunately because of time constraints and some roadblocks that the project had at the very start, the service was put on hiatus, however we really want to have at least a new beta publicly available, this means that probably at the end of 2024 or mid 2025 we will start the incremental release of public betas of various SurfScape services, mainly GameVortex and/or NeoFrames. We also want to release our first software, that being Celer, a modular, advanced, Windows utility with cleaning, monitoring, and privacy protection capabilities.

## Closing off

So this is it, SurfScape stable is now public, we hope you enjoy what is coming next, thank your for the support! Signing off...
