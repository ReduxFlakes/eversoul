At SurfScape, we understand the importance of privacy and are committed to protecting our users' personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines our approach to safeguarding your privacy when using our web portal.

## Collection of Information

We do not collect any personal information from our users, such as names, addresses, or email addresses. We do not track user activity or gather any analytics data.

## Use of Information

Since we do not collect any personal information or track user activity, we do not use any information for statistical purposes or for any other purposes.

## Security

We prioritize the security of our users' information and have implemented appropriate measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of personal information. However, as we do not collect personal information, there is no user-specific data to secure.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

As SurfScape does not provide any services that involve collecting personal information, this Privacy Policy is not applicable. We do not collect, use, or disclose any personal information.
