This document details our usage of non-personal and personal data. This also includes our methods of collecting data, our partners, and 3rd party services we use.

## Usage of data

Most of the data collected is used for the necessary execution of a service, API, or basic telemetry.

This is more detailed on the ~~[data collection](#collected-information)~~ section

## Collected Information

We _only_ collect telemetry data. Personal data might be given when filling forms or sending e-maills, which is something that is still not available at the moment.
