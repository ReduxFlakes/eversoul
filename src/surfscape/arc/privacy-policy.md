<summary>Revision 2</summary>
This document details our usage of non-personal and personal data. This also includes our methods of collecting data, our partners, and 3rd party services we use.

## Usage of data

Most of the data collected is used for the necessary execution of a service, API, or basic telemetry.

This means that we only use data for statistics, so we can know how much a service is being used and then work more towards it to improve it.

## Collected Information

We only collect telemetry data. Personal data might be given when filling forms or sending submissions trough email but that is not required if you don't do such things.

Below is a detailed overview of our providers and what data is collected trough them.
